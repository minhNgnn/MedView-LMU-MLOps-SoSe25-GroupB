Introduction
============

The Brain Tumor Monitoring System is a comprehensive MLOps solution designed to monitor and detect data drift in machine learning models that classify brain tumor images. This system provides real-time monitoring, automated drift detection, and comprehensive reporting capabilities to ensure the reliability and accuracy of medical AI systems.

Problem Statement
----------------

In medical AI applications, particularly brain tumor classification, model performance can degrade over time due to:

* **Data Drift**: Changes in image characteristics, lighting conditions, or scanning protocols
* **Concept Drift**: Evolution in tumor characteristics or classification criteria
* **Model Decay**: Gradual degradation of model performance over time
* **Quality Issues**: Variations in image quality, artifacts, or preprocessing

Traditional monitoring approaches often fail to detect these issues early, leading to:

* **Reduced Model Accuracy**: Degraded performance affecting patient care
* **False Positives/Negatives**: Incorrect classifications with serious medical implications
* **Lack of Transparency**: Inability to explain model decisions and drift patterns
* **Reactive Response**: Late detection of issues requiring emergency model updates

Solution Overview
----------------

Our Brain Tumor Monitoring System addresses these challenges through:

**Comprehensive Feature Extraction**
    Automatic extraction of 20+ image features including brightness, contrast, entropy, and tumor-specific characteristics.

**Advanced Drift Detection**
    Statistical analysis comparing current data distributions against reference datasets with customizable thresholds.

**Real-time Monitoring**
    Continuous monitoring of model predictions with immediate alerting for significant drift.

**Automated Reporting**
    HTML reports with visualizations using Evidently AI for stakeholder communication.

**Scalable Architecture**
    Microservices-based design supporting cloud deployment and horizontal scaling.
